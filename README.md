# CMSC828C-project-1

Implementated Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Gaussian assumption followed by Bayes rule for classification. Also implemented the same after applying PCA and LDA for dimensionality reduction

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

To run this project one needs to set up a virtual environment in the pc. For Anaconda users it can be done as follows:

```
conda update conda
```
```
conda create -n yourenvname python=x.x anaconda
```
Press y to proceed. This will install the Python version and all the associated anaconda packaged libraries at “path_to_your_anaconda_location/anaconda/envs/yourenvname”
To activate the virtual environment:
```
source activate yourenvname
```

### Installing

Once in the virtual environemnet:

* To clone this repo in your virtual environment:
'''
git clone https://github.com/adityavaishampayan/CMSC828C-project1.git
'''
* cd to the CMSC828C-project1 folder and then install the requirements file 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the required libraries to run this project

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
